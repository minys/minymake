minymake
========
Small build enginge inspired by Robert Miller's "Recursive Make Considered
Harmful".

A module *must* declare the following variables:

 target : Name of the executable or library that this module is responsible
          for. Only one executable or library is allowed per module file and
          type is deducted from the precense of the suffix '.so'.
 src    : Whitespace separated list of source files used to build 'target'.

A module *might* declare the following variables:

 cflags        : Target specific CFLAGS.
 cxxflags      : Target specific CXXFLAGS.
 ldflags       : Target specific LDFLAGS.

Modules cannot include other modules, everything needs to be orchestrated
from one top level makefile (or several separate ones).

Flags that can be declared outside of build.mk and used for different targets:

Used by all targets:
 CFLAGS
 CXXFLAGS
 LDFLAGS

Used by 'debug' target:
 DEBUG_CFLAGS
 DEBUG_CXXFLAGS

Used by 'gcov' target:
 GCOV_CFLAGS
 GCOV_CXXFLAGS
 GCOV_LDFLAGS

Used by 'release' target:
 RELEASE_CFLAGS
 RELEASE_CXXFLAGS

Used by 'static' target:
 STATIC_CFLAGS
 STATIC_CXXFLAGS
 STATIC_LDFLAGS

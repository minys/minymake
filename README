minymake
========
Small build enginge inspired by Robert Miller's "Recursive Make Considered
Harmful".

A module *must* declare the following variables:

 target : Name of the executable or library that this module is responsible
          for. Only one executable or library is allowed per module file and
          type is deducted from the precense of the suffix '.so'.
 src    : Whitespace separated list of source files used to build 'target'.

A module *might* declare the following variables:

 cflags        : Target specific CFLAGS.
 cxxflags      : Target specific CXXFLAGS.
 ldflags       : Target specific LDFLAGS.

Modules cannot include other modules, everything needs to be orchestrated
from one top level makefile (or several separate ones).
